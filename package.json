  "description": "- TFT Academy App is an interactive sheet of data that holds information for all the units of the new set in Riot Games Autobattler game TeamFight Tactics. One tab will include data from whichever unit you wish to see, from their traits, abilities and stats on each upgrade. TFT Academy shows the user all the units in a sidebar. From all these units, they can click one and all of that units'data will be displayed on the right. Along with this, there will be a chart that will prompt the user to click a listed stat, that will then display a chart of all the units ordered by that stat from either ascending or descending order. - A second tab will render an empty grid that will allow the user to place the units onto the board essentially creating a custom team of units they like. The board will update its statistics dynamically depending on the unit the user wishes to place onto it. This will allow the user to theorycraft and view builds before testing them out in the real game.",
